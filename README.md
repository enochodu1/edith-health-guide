## 🎯 Key Findings & Recommendations

### Critical Discoveries:

**1. Gout Risk (HIGH - 6 Factors)**
- Furosemide (Lasix) increases uric acid 25-50%
- Type 2 diabetes increases uric acid 30%
- Obesity, high BP, post-menopause, bilateral knee swelling
- **May explain 50% of her joint pain**
- Urgent: Uric acid blood test needed

**2. Medication Problems:**
- Tylenol #3 (codeine) causes severe constipation
- Thyroid pills taken with food = only 30-50% absorption
- Ozempic maximum dose causing unbearable bloating
- Furosemide depletes potassium (dangerous!)

**3. Diet Issues:**
- Maggi cubes cancel blood pressure medications
- High-salt diet prevents Lasix from working
- 30-40% of bloating from high sodium

### Top 5 Interventions:

1. **Test & Treat Gout** - Simple blood test, 90-95% treatable
2. **Add Losartan** - 4 benefits (BP, gout, kidneys, blood sugar)
3. **Fix Thyroid Timing** - 6 AM water only, wait 1 hour (doubles energy)
4. **Eliminate Maggi Cubes** - Cancels all medications
5. **Lose 40 Pounds** - Fixes or improves EVERY condition
